- Updated deals API route to use real ITAD data
- Added credentials to .env file
- OAuth redirect URL for testing: http://localhost:3002/api/auth/callback/itad

Verified:
- ITAD API successfully returns real deal data (GOG, Humble Store, Steam prices)
- Historical low prices displayed ($3.99 for Witcher 3)
- Deal URLs link to ITAD affiliate links (itad.link)
- Graceful fallback to mock data if ITAD unavailable
