## Server
- Development server runs on http://localhost:3000
- Start with: `npm run dev --prefix /g/Projects/NextUp`

## Database
- Using SQLite for development (prisma/dev.db)
- Schema defined in prisma/schema.prisma
- Run `npx prisma db push` to sync schema

## What Should Be Worked On Next
1. Feature #2: User registration with email/password
2. More authentication-related features
3. Group creation and management

## Known Issues
- Playwright browser automation has issues with Chrome installation (using curl for testing)

## Notes
- All protected routes correctly redirect to /login with callbackUrl
- The app uses NextAuth.js JWT strategy for sessions
- Prisma schema updated to use SQLite instead of PostgreSQL for easier setup
